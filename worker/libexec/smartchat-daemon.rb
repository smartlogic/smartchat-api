# IMPORTANT CONFIGURATION NOTES
#
# The aws-sdk gem provides various mechanisms for configuring the
# client libraries. It is recommended that you look at the
# documentation for the most up-to-date or appropriate way of
# configuring it.
#
# At the time of writing, the (aws-sdk) gem will attempt to use
# environment variables or the EC2 metadata service to auto-configure
# itself. If this is not the case, you can pass configuration options
# into DaemonKit::SQS.run which will be passed on to the underlying
# AWS::SQS client. By default, we use the 'config/sqs.yml' file to do
# this configuration.

# Run an event-loop for processing
